Description: Use Ranked analysis for Transcriptomes to project
    any sample into a space of interest.
    spaceRAT ranks the differentially expressed genes in your sample data
    and uses that information to project it into a prebuilt or
    user-built scaffold space. spaceRAT provides plotting functions that
    allows the user to visually investigate their sample data.
