\title{Project new sample(s) onto existing scaffold PCA plot}
\usage{
projectSample(
  space,
  object,
  assay = "counts",
  pheno = NULL,
  colname = "cancer_type",
  title = "Samples projected onto scaffold PCA",
  verbose = TRUE,
  annotation = "ensembl_gene"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{space}{A scaffoldSpace object, returned by function \code{\link{buildScaffold}}}

\item{object}{An expression matrix of class SummarizedExperiment, SingleCellExperiment, matrix, or a data frame. Column names are sample names.
Row names are gene names, which can be Ensembl Gene ID, HGNC Symbol, Entrez Gene ID Ensembl, Transcript ID or Refseq mRNA.
All gene ID will be automatically converted to Ensembl Gene ID. If you want to retain your gene identifier that is not currently supported, please specify \code{annotation=NA}. See parameter \code{annotation} for more information.
Counts of several transcript ID corresponding to same gene will be added and recorded as the counts of the gene.
To use the pre-built scaffold, simply set object="prebuilt_DMAP", or "prebuilt_GTEX", and no need to specify any other parameter.}

\item{assay}{(Default: "counts") The assay slot to use with your Bioconductor object.}

\item{colname}{A column name of \code{pheno_sample}. This column of values will be used to annotate projected samples.
This argument should be set together with \code{pheno_sample}.
If \code{pheno_sample} is not specified, this argument will be ignored, and the output plot will not show legends for new samples.}

\item{title}{Title of the plot.}

\item{verbose}{A logical vector indicating whether to report the number of genes imputed to make \code{counts_sample} compatible with \code{counts_scaffold}}

\item{annotation}{Annotation type to use for scaffold. counts_scaffold rownames using alternative identifiers will be translated.
Currently ensembl_gene, entrez, hgnc_symbol, and refseq_mrna are supported. set to "NA", to avoid translation (both scaffold and projected samples must be the same)}

\item{pheno_sample}{Phenotype data corresponding to \code{counts_sample}. If not specified, the output plot will not show legends for new samples.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object with new samples projected to existing scaffold PCA plot
}
\description{
This function takes in a \code{\link{scaffoldSpace}} objects, subsets the new dataset to contain only the genes that defines the scaffold space,
ranks the subset within new sample(s),
finally projects the new sample(s) onto the existing scaffold PCA plot.
}
\examples{
space <- DMAP_scaffold # or create your own scaffoldSpace
projectSample(space,exprs_ilaria,pData_ilaria,"cancer_type")
}
